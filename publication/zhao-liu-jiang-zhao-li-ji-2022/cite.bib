 abstractnote = {3D meshes are widely employed to represent geometry structure of 3D shapes. Due to limitation of scanning sensor precision and other issues, meshes are inevitably affected by noise, which hampers the subsequent applications. Convolultional neural networks (CNNs) achieve great success in image processing tasks, including 2D image denoising, and have been proven to own the capacity of modeling complex features at different scales, which is also particularly useful for mesh denoising. However, due to the nature of irregular structure, CNNs-based denosing strategies cannot be trivially applied for meshes. To circumvent this limitation, in the paper, we propose the local surface descriptor (LSD), which is able to transform the local deformable surface around a face into 2D grid representation and thus facilitates the deployment of CNNs to generate denoised face normals. To verify the superiority of LSD, we directly feed LSD into the classical Resnet without any complicated network design. The extensive experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-arts, our method achieves encouraging performance with respect to both objective and subjective evaluations.},
